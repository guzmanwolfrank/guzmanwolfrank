- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @guzmanwolfrank

I am currently coding in Python. 

I like to focus on market algorithms and data analysis using Python. 

Preferably Linux + Windows os. 

Most programs I am interested in are short, quant, scripts made for tools or quick widgets that help traders gain insight quickly. 



Thanks for stopping by.

Wolfrank
