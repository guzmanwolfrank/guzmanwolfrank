Hi, 

I am currently coding in Python while attaining more skills at the AWS Architect Associate level. 
The goal is to continue to build and deploy Cloud Architecture solutions and automated market strategies within the AWS cloud. 

My special interests within Cloud environments include storage and compute services in AWS.  I also enjoy working on data analysis using Python, Excel and SQL based Databases. 

All algo code is constantly updated privately,however I love to collab and share public access to AWS Cloud projects pertaining to work in the Architect Associate ranks! 

Thank you!
