Hi, 

I am currently coding in Python while sharpening my skills at the AWS Architect Associate level. 
The goal is to continue to build and deploy AWS Cloud Architecture solutions and automated market strategies within the AWS cloud.

I mainly trade American Futures within the CME Globex system.  My emphasis is on the Nasdaq 100 Index Futures, both the Emini and Micro contract. 

Algo strategies are designed mainly for Forex and Futures.  



Thank you!
