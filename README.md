Hi, 
My name is Wolfrank Guzman. <br/>

You can view my site at [GuzmanWolfrank](https://guzmanwolfrank.github.io/) and I focus most of my Python scripts on the following:
<br/>

[Data & SQL:](https://github.com/guzmanwolfrank/Data-SQL)

          including probability, hypothesis testing, and regression analysis.

          Instance management and Service Architecture. 
          
          Alexa Project:  I am looking to connect AWS Alexa to Oanda via oandapyv20. 
          The Goal is to produce a working prototype and .exe file written and packed in Python.
