Hi, 

I am currently coding in Python while sharpening my skills at the AWS Architect Associate level. 
The goal is to continue to build and deploy AWS Cloud Architecture solutions and automated market strategies within the AWS cloud.

I mainly trade American Futures within the CME Globex system.  My emphasis is on the Nasdaq 100 Index Futures, both the Emini and Micro contract. 

Algo strategies are designed mainly for Forex and Futures.  

Combining AWS Services with market strategies can help account mirroring and automated strategies. Continuously running instances can also execute trading and market data functions using AWS Services such as Lambda.   

My special interests within Cloud environments include storage and compute services in AWS.  I also enjoy working on data analysis using Python, Excel and SQL based Databases. 

All algo market code is constantly updated privately, however I love to collab, send me an inquiry for algo strategies and I also share public access to AWS Cloud projects pertaining to work in the Architect Associate role. 


Thank you!
